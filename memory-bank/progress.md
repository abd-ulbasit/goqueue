# GoQueue - Progress

## Overall Status

**Phase**: 4 of 4
**Milestones**: 20/26 complete (M11: Leader Election & Replication - IN PROGRESS)
**Tests**: 640+ passing (storage: 50+, broker: 470+, api: 24, grpc: 16, client: 14, cluster: 50+)
**Started**: Session 1

## Latest Session - Topic Metadata Sync & Partition API

### What Was Accomplished

**Topic Metadata Sync (FIXED)**:
- **Problem**: Topics created on controller weren't visible on followers for replication
- **Root Cause**: `handleMetadataChange` in cluster_integration.go was a stub that only logged
- **Fix**: Added `ensureLocalTopic()` that creates topics locally when metadata is synced
- Added `CreateTopicLocal()` to broker - creates topic without re-registering with cluster metadata
- Now when controller creates a topic, followers automatically create it locally via metadata sync

**Partition Leader API (NEW)**:
- Added `GET /topics/{topicName}/partitions` endpoint
- Returns: partition number, leader, replicas, ISR, version for each partition
- Example response:
  ```json
  {
    "partitions": [
      {"partition": 0, "leader": "goqueue-0", "replicas": ["goqueue-0", "goqueue-1", "goqueue-2"], "isr": ["goqueue-0", "goqueue-1", "goqueue-2"], "version": 1}
    ],
    "topic": "sync-test3"
  }
  ```

**Failover Testing (VERIFIED)**:
- Tested node death by scaling down: `kubectl scale statefulset goqueue --replicas=2`
- Failure detector correctly identifies dead nodes (~12s)
- Leader election occurs when nodes rejoin
- ISR tracking works - all 3 nodes in ISR when healthy
- Epoch/version increments on leadership changes
- Unclean election prevention working: "no ISR available, unclean election disabled"

### Code Changes

**`internal/broker/cluster_integration.go`**:
- `handleMetadataChange()`: Now iterates through all topics in metadata and calls `ensureLocalTopic()`
- Added `ensureLocalTopic(name, partitions)`: Creates topic locally from cluster metadata

**`internal/broker/broker.go`**:
- Added `CreateTopicLocal(config TopicConfig)`: Creates topic without cluster metadata registration
- Used for metadata sync - idempotent (returns nil if topic exists)

**`internal/api/server.go`**:
- Added route: `r.Get("/partitions", s.getTopicPartitions)`
- Handler calls `b.GetTopicPartitions(topicName)` and returns JSON

### Test Results

- 3-node EKS cluster running with v0.5.0-isr3
- Topic creation on controller syncs to all followers
- Partition API returns correct leader/replica/ISR information
- Failover tested: node death detected, re-election works

### Docker Images

- `v0.5.0-isr3`: Latest with metadata sync fix
- Built with cross-compilation: `CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64`

### Known Gaps

1. **Request Routing**: Writes to non-leader partitions go locally instead of forwarding to leader
2. **Synchronous Replication**: WaitForReplication is called but may not wait for ISR ack
3. **Leader Election on Death**: Works but needs more testing

---

## Previous Session - Cluster Formation Fix & Failover Detection

### What Was Accomplished

**CRITICAL BUG FIX: Coordinator Context Lifecycle**:
- **Root Cause**: Bootstrap used `context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 60s)` 
- The coordinator's `c.ctx` was derived from this timeout context
- When bootstrap completed and `defer cancel()` ran, it cancelled the coordinator's context
- This caused `heartbeatLoop` to exit immediately (context cancelled)
- **Fix**: Use `context.Background()` for coordinator's long-running context

**Fixed Heartbeat Loop**:
- Previously: Heartbeat loop started then immediately stopped (context cancelled)
- Now: Heartbeat loop runs continuously, sending heartbeats every 3s
- Verified: Nodes stay alive without being marked dead

**Failure Detection Working**:
- Failure detector correctly identifies nodes that stop heartbeating
- Suspect timeout: 6s (2 missed heartbeats)
- Dead timeout: 9s (3 missed heartbeats)
- Tested: Killed pod, node was marked suspect→dead correctly

**Controller Election on Death**:
- When controller dies, remaining nodes trigger new election
- Log observed: "controller died, triggering election"
- New controller elected successfully

**Partition Failover Code**:
- Added `ElectLeadersForNode()` call in `handleMembershipEvent`
- Triggers partition leader election when a node dies
- Only runs on controller node

### Code Changes

**`internal/cluster/coordinator.go`**:
- Fixed context lifecycle: `c.ctx, c.cancel = context.WithCancel(context.Background())`
- Added `partitionElector *PartitionLeaderElector` field
- `handleMembershipEvent` triggers partition failover on `EventNodeDied`

**`internal/cluster/cluster_server.go`**:
- `handleJoin` now calls `RecordHeartbeat` for joining nodes
- `BroadcastHeartbeats` uses `GetOtherNodes()` (includes suspect, skips dead)

**`internal/cluster/failure_detector.go`**:
- `Start()` seeds initial heartbeats for existing nodes
- Added membership listener for newly joined nodes
- Detection loop correctly marks nodes as suspect→dead

**`internal/cluster/membership.go`**:
- Fixed `ApplyState` version comparison for Version=0 case

### Test Results

- 3-node EKS cluster running stable
- All nodes remain alive with continuous heartbeats
- Failure detection tested: killed node detected as dead within 9s
- Controller re-election verified
- Cluster recovers when killed pod restarts

### Docker Images Built

- `v0.5.0-failover` through `v0.5.0-failover9`
- Latest stable: `v0.5.0-failover9`

### Known Issues

1. **Topic Sync**: Topics created on one node not immediately visible on others
2. **Partition Leader API**: No endpoint to view partition leaders
3. **Kubernetes restart**: When pod restarts quickly, failover partially executes

## Previous Session - 3-Node Cluster Deployment & High-Throughput Benchmarks

### What Was Built

**Cluster Deployment Bug Fixes**:
- Fixed `normalizeAddr()` function in `cmd/goqueue/main.go` - was prepending `:` to full addresses like `0.0.0.0:8080` creating invalid `:0.0.0.0:8080`
- Added `strings` import for `LastIndex` usage
- Docker image rebuilt and pushed as `v0.4.1` and `latest`

**Docker Build Optimization**:
- Created `.dockerignore` reducing build context from 1GB to 65MB
- Excludes: .git/, data/, website/, docs/, terraform state, node_modules/

**StatefulSet Configuration** (`deploy/kubernetes/manual/statefulset.yaml`):
- `podManagementPolicy: Parallel` for simultaneous pod startup
- Environment variables for cluster mode:
  - `GOQUEUE_BROKER_NODEID` from pod name
  - `GOQUEUE_CLUSTER_ENABLED=true`
  - `GOQUEUE_CLUSTER_PEERS` with all 3 node addresses
  - `GOQUEUE_CLUSTER_ADVERTISE` for inter-node discovery
  - `GOQUEUE_LISTENERS_HTTP/GRPC/INTERNAL` bound to 0.0.0.0

**Benchmark Jobs**:
- Created `publish-benchmark.yaml` for comprehensive publish testing
- Tests: Sequential, concurrent (4-32 threads), batch (10-1000 msgs)

### Benchmark Results (3-Node EKS Cluster, c5.xlarge)

**In-Cluster Benchmarks** (minimal network latency):

| Mode | Configuration | Throughput |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Sequential | 1 msg at a time | **~320 msgs/sec** |
| Concurrent | 8 threads | **~1,300 msgs/sec** |
| Batch (100) | 100 msgs/batch | **~30,000 msgs/sec** |
| Batch (1000) | 1000 msgs/batch | **~220,000 msgs/sec** |

**Scaling Analysis**:
```
Batch Size    Throughput       vs Sequential
─────────────────────────────────────────────
     1        ~320/s           baseline
    10        ~3,000/s         ~10x
   100        ~30,000/s        ~100x
   500        ~130,000/s       ~400x
  1000        ~220,000/s       ~700x
```

**Concurrent Thread Scaling**:
```
Threads    Throughput    vs Single Thread
────────────────────────────────────────
   4       ~1,140/s      3.5x
   8       ~1,300/s      4x (optimal)
  16       ~1,030/s      diminishing returns
  32       ~1,030/s      contention
```

### Documentation Updates

**Created `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`**:
- Full benchmark methodology and results
- Hardware recommendations by workload
- Comparison with other systems
- Instructions to run benchmarks

**Updated `README.md` Performance Section**:
- In-cluster benchmark results
- Batch scaling chart
- Comparison table with Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS

### Key Learnings

**Network is the Bottleneck for Sequential Publish**:
- Remote (150ms RTT): ~30 msgs/sec
- In-cluster: ~320 msgs/sec (10x faster)
- Batch mode: eliminates network as bottleneck

**Batch Amortizes Per-Request Overhead**:
- TCP connection, HTTP parsing, logging all happen once per batch
- 100 msg batch = 100x throughput improvement
- 1000 msg batch = 700x throughput improvement

**Cluster State Not Yet Replicated**:
- Topics created on one node aren't visible to others
- LoadBalancer routes to different pods = inconsistent state
- This is expected - topic replication is future work

### Files Changed

- `cmd/goqueue/main.go` - Fixed normalizeAddr function
- `.dockerignore` - Created for build optimization
- `deploy/kubernetes/manual/statefulset.yaml` - Cluster env vars
- `deploy/kubernetes/manual/publish-benchmark.yaml` - Benchmark job
- `deploy/kubernetes/manual/full-benchmark.yaml` - Full test suite
- `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` - Performance documentation
- `README.md` - Updated Performance section

## Previous Session - EKS Benchmarks & Deployment Improvements

### What Was Built

**Benchmarking Infrastructure**:
- Fixed benchmark tests to use correct API field (`num_partitions` not `partitions`)
- Fixed Python benchmark API paths (removed `/api/v1/` prefix, fixed poll endpoint)
- Fixed TypeScript benchmark API paths (same fixes as Python)

**Benchmark Results (AWS EKS, ap-south-1, LoadBalancer, ~150ms RTT)**:

| Test | Go | Python | TypeScript |
|------|-----|--------|------------|
| Single message (1KB) | 6.3 msg/s | - | - |
| Batch 100 × 1KB | 112 msg/s | 331 msg/s | 284 msg/s |
| Batch 100 × 100B | 365 msg/s | - | - |
| Batch 1000 × 100B | 1,090 msg/s | - | - |
| 8 Concurrent | 152 msg/s | 567 msg/s | 571 msg/s |
| Sustained (30s) | - | 552 msg/s | 549 msg/s |

**Deployment Simplification** (`deploy/deploy.sh`):
- One-command EKS deployment: `./deploy.sh deploy dev`
- GoQueue-only deployment: `./deploy.sh goqueue dev`
- LoadBalancer URL retrieval: `./deploy.sh url dev`
- Status check: `./deploy.sh status dev`
- Benchmark runner: `./deploy.sh benchmark dev`
- Teardown: `./deploy.sh destroy dev`

**Docker Image Updates**:
- Pushed `ghcr.io/abd-ulbasit/goqueue:latest` with K8s fixes
- Tagged as `v0.2.0` for release tracking
- Kubernetes fixes: env vars for data directory and listener addresses

**README Updates**:
- Added Performance section with benchmark results
- Updated Quick Start with Kubernetes deployment instructions
- Added Helm installation command

### Key Learnings

**Multi-replica Load Balancing Issue**:
- With 3 replicas, topic created on pod1 but publish routed to pod2
- Root cause: pods have independent state (not clustered)
- Solution: Scale to 1 replica OR implement proper clustering

**Network Latency Impact**:
- Single-message throughput limited by RTT (~150ms each way)
- Batching is critical for throughput (100x improvement)
- Concurrent producers help saturate network

**Client Language Comparison**:
- Go client: Fastest raw throughput with small batches
- Python/TS: Better sustained throughput with HTTP connection pooling
- All clients: Similar performance with concurrent producers

## Previous Session - QuotaEnforcer Refactoring

### What Was Built

**QuotaEnforcer Strategy Pattern** (`internal/broker/quota_enforcer.go`):
- Interface for abstracting quota enforcement
- Methods: CheckPublish, CheckPublishBatch, CheckConsume, CheckTopicCreation, CheckConsumerGroup, CheckDelay, TrackUsage, IsEnabled
- Two implementations:
  - `NoOpEnforcer`: Single-tenant mode - all methods return nil (zero overhead)
  - `TenantQuotaEnforcer`: Multi-tenant mode - delegates to QuotaManager

**Why**: Eliminated 14 scattered `if b.tenantManager != nil` checks in tenant_broker.go

**Broker Changes** (`internal/broker/broker.go`):
- Added `quotaEnforcer QuotaEnforcer` field to Broker struct
- Initialization sets appropriate enforcer based on EnableMultiTenancy config

**tenant_broker.go Refactoring**:
- Replaced all 14 nil checks with direct `b.quotaEnforcer.CheckX()` calls
- Clean, testable code without conditionals

**CLI Consistency** (`cmd/goqueue-admin/`):
- Added `handleError()` function matching goqueue-cli pattern
- Updated 15 API error handlers across tenant.go, quota.go, usage.go
- Consistent user-facing error output using `cli.PrintError()`

### Pattern Learned: Strategy for Optional Features

When a feature is optional (like multi-tenancy), use strategy pattern:
1. Define interface with all operations
2. Create NoOp implementation (does nothing, zero cost)
3. Create real implementation (actual logic)
4. Select at initialization based on config

This gives: clean code, zero overhead when disabled, testability.

---

## Milestone 18 - Multi-Tenancy & Quotas ⭐ (COMPLETE!)

### What Was Built

**Optional Multi-Tenancy** (`internal/broker/broker.go`):
- `EnableMultiTenancy bool` config flag (default: false)
- TenantManager initialized only when enabled
- Single-tenant mode: zero overhead, direct topic access
- Multi-tenant mode: full isolation and quotas

**Deployment Models**:
- **Single-tenant (default)**: For K8s deployments where each customer gets own cluster
- **Multi-tenant**: For managed service / SaaS deployments with quotas

**Tenant Management** (`internal/broker/tenant.go`):
- Tenant entity with ID, name, status (active/suspended/disabled), quotas, metadata
- TenantManager for CRUD operations with file-based persistence
- Namespace isolation via topic prefix pattern: `{tenantID}.{topicName}`
- System tenant (`__system`) for internal topics
- Tenant lifecycle: create → active → suspended → active → disabled
- Usage tracking: messages, bytes, topics, partitions, connections

**Token Bucket Rate Limiting** (`internal/broker/quota.go`):
- Industry-standard token bucket algorithm (O(1), allows bursts)
- Per-tenant rate limiting for publish and consume
- Configurable capacity and refill rate
- Thread-safe implementation with atomic operations

**Quota Manager** (`internal/broker/quota_manager.go`):
- Centralized quota enforcement
- Check methods for all quota types:
  - `CheckPublishRate`, `CheckConsumeRate` (message rate)
  - `CheckPublishBytesRate`, `CheckConsumeBytesRate` (throughput)
  - `CheckMessageSize` (single message limit)
  - `CheckStorageQuota` (total storage per tenant)
  - `CheckTopicCreation` (topic count, partition count)
  - `CheckConsumerGroupCount` (connection limits)
  - `CheckDelay` (max delay for scheduled messages)
- Violation tracking per tenant

**Broker Integration** (`internal/broker/tenant_broker.go`):
- `IsMultiTenantEnabled()` method
- Tenant-aware broker methods:
  - `PublishForTenant`, `PublishBatchForTenant`
  - `ConsumeForTenant`
  - `CreateTopicForTenant`, `DeleteTopicForTenant`, `ListTopicsForTenant`
  - `PublishWithDelayForTenant`, `PublishWithPriorityForTenant`
  - `JoinGroupForTenant`
- Quota enforcement at broker layer (catches all paths, bypassed when disabled)
- Usage tracking after successful operations

**HTTP API** (`internal/api/tenant_api.go`):
- REST endpoints at `/admin/tenants/*`:
  - CRUD: `POST /admin/tenants`, `GET /admin/tenants/{id}`, etc.
  - Lifecycle: `POST /admin/tenants/{id}/suspend|activate|disable`
  - Quotas: `GET|PUT /admin/tenants/{id}/quotas`
  - Usage: `GET /admin/tenants/{id}/usage|stats`
  - Resources: `GET /admin/tenants/{id}/topics`
- Returns 503 when multi-tenancy disabled

**Admin CLI** (`cmd/goqueue-admin/`):
- Separate CLI for superadmin operations
- Uses shared `internal/cli` package (same as goqueue-cli)
- Commands:
  - `tenant create|list|get|delete|suspend|activate|disable`
  - `quota get|update|reset`
  - `usage get`
- Table/JSON/YAML output formats

### Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Default mode | Single-tenant | K8s deployments need no multi-tenant overhead |
| Namespace isolation | Topic prefix | Simple, works with existing storage, no major refactoring |
| Rate limiting | Token bucket | O(1), allows bursts, industry standard |
| Quota enforcement | Broker layer | Catches all paths, not just API |
| Persistence | File-based JSON | Simple, reliable, matches existing patterns |
| When disabled | Skip all checks | Zero overhead, direct topic access |
| Quota types priority | Rate → Storage → Count → Size | Rate limits are most time-sensitive |
| Exceeded behavior | Reject immediately | Clear error, no partial processing |

### Key Concepts Learned

**Multi-tenancy approaches**:
- Namespace isolation (topic prefix) - goqueue, Kafka conventions
- Virtual hosts - RabbitMQ
- Account-level isolation - AWS SQS

**Token Bucket Algorithm**:
- Tokens refill at constant rate up to capacity
- Operations consume tokens
- Allows bursts up to capacity
- O(1) operations, thread-safe

**Quota types**:
- Rate quotas (msg/sec, bytes/sec) - controlled by token bucket
- Storage quotas (total bytes, topic count) - simple threshold checks
- Connection quotas (concurrent connections, consumer groups)

## Critical Issues Fixed (2026-01-11)

### Category 1 - All Fixed ✅
1. **M5+M6 Integration** - Added `PublishWithDelayAndPriority` and `PublishAtWithPriority` methods
2. **Delay Filtering** - Was already implemented (stale TODO removed)
3. **Transaction Abort Retry** - Added `abortTransactionWithRetry` with exponential backoff
4. **OTLP/Jaeger** - Replaced stubs with official OpenTelemetry SDK implementation

### Race Condition Fixes (2026-01-11)
1. **GetNode Data Race** - `ClusterState.GetNode()` now returns a clone to prevent races
2. **Event Listener Race** - `TestMembership_EventListener` now uses mutex for event tracking

### Key Concepts Learned

**StatefulSet vs Deployment**:
- StatefulSet: Ordered pod creation, stable network IDs (goqueue-0, goqueue-1), PVC per pod
- Deployment: Random pod names, shared storage, stateless
- For message queues: Always StatefulSet (need stable identity for Raft, persistent storage)

**Headless Service**:
- `clusterIP: None` creates DNS records for each pod
- `goqueue-0.goqueue-headless.namespace.svc.cluster.local`
- Essential for Raft peer discovery

**PodDisruptionBudget**:
- Limits voluntary disruptions (upgrades, node drain)
- `minAvailable: 2` ensures majority for Raft quorum
- Kubernetes respects PDB during maintenance

**StorageClass per Cloud**:
- AWS: gp3 (newest, best price/performance)
- GCP: premium-rwo (regional SSD, auto-replication)
- Azure: managed-premium (SSD-backed)

**Chaos Engineering Categories**:
1. Pod failures (kill, OOM)
2. Node failures (drain, shutdown)
3. Network failures (partition, latency)
4. Storage failures (disk pressure, corruption)

## Up Next – Milestone 16 (CLI Tool)

- **Objective**: Provide command-line interface for managing goqueue

## Milestone 15 - gRPC API & Go Client ⭐ (COMPLETE!)

### What Was Built

**gRPC Server** (`internal/grpc/`):
- Protocol Buffers v3 definitions with comprehensive service contracts
- `PublishService` - Single message and streaming publish
- `ConsumeService` - Server streaming for continuous message delivery
- `AckService` - Message acknowledgment (ack, nack, reject, extend visibility)
- `OffsetService` - Consumer offset commit, fetch, and reset
- `HealthService` - Standard gRPC health checking
- Request logging interceptor for observability
- Integration with existing broker

**Go Client Library** (`pkg/client/`):
- Low-level `Client` - Direct gRPC wrapper with all operations
- High-level `Producer` - Async sending, batching, key-based partitioning
- High-level `Consumer` - Consumer group support, auto-ack, message channels
- Connection management with keepalives
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive comments explaining patterns

**Integration**:
- gRPC server starts alongside HTTP server in main.go
- Port 9000 for gRPC, Port 8080 for HTTP
- Graceful shutdown handling

**Tests**:
- `internal/grpc/server_test.go` - 13 tests covering all services
- `pkg/client/client_test.go` - 14 tests for client library
- Integration tests for publish/consume flow
- Concurrent access tests

### Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Protocol | gRPC with HTTP/2 | Binary, streaming, multiplexed |
| Consume Pattern | Server streaming | Push-based, efficient |
| Error Handling | gRPC status codes | Standard, well-defined |
| Client Design | Low-level + High-level | Flexibility + convenience |
| Health Check | Standard protocol | Compatible with K8s, load balancers |

## What Works

### Milestone 14 - Time Index, Snapshots & Log Compaction ⭐ (Partial Complete!)
- **Time Index** ✅:
  - Binary format mapping timestamp→offset (16 bytes per entry)
  - 4KB granularity (same as offset index for consistency)
  - O(log n) binary search for time-based lookups
  - Segment methods: `ReadFromTimestamp()`, `ReadTimeRange()`, `GetFirstTimestamp()`, `GetLastTimestamp()`
  - Corruption recovery: automatic rebuild from segment data
  - Test coverage: 9 tests, all passing
- **Coordinator Snapshots** ✅:
  - Binary snapshot format (32-byte header + variable entries)
  - CRC32 validation for corruption detection
  - Snapshot triggers: 10K records OR 5 minutes (whichever first)
  - Keep last 3 snapshots, auto-cleanup of old ones
  - Supports group coordinator and transaction coordinator state
  - File format: `snapshot-{type}-{offset}-{timestamp}.bin`
  - `SnapshotWriter`, `SnapshotReader`, `SnapshotManager` with complete lifecycle
  - Test coverage: 9 tests, all passing
- **Log Compaction** 🔄 (Planned):
  - Copy-on-compact strategy documented
  - Dirty ratio trigger (50% duplicates)
  - Tombstone retention (24 hours)
  - Needs integration with Log API (current implementation accesses segments directly)
  - Recommended approach: Topic-level compaction with directory-level operations

### Milestone 13 - Online Partition Scaling + Coordinators on Internal Topic ✅ ⭐
- **Internal Topic Infrastructure**:
  - `__consumer_offsets` internal topic (50 partitions, replication factor 3)
  - Binary format for offset commits and group metadata
  - Hash-based group-to-partition mapping: `partition = murmur3(groupID) % 50`
  - `InternalTopicManager` for lifecycle management
- **Fault-Tolerant Coordinator**:
  - `GroupCoordinator` interface abstracting coordinator implementations
  - `PartitionBackedCoordinator` persisting state to `__consumer_offsets`
  - `CoordinatorRouter` for hash-based routing to correct coordinator
  - Coordinator failover via ISR election (no bespoke election path)
- **Online Partition Scaling**:
  - Kafka-style scaling (add only, never reduce)
  - `PartitionScaler` with validation, assignment, and notification
  - Round-robin replica assignment across cluster nodes
  - Consumer group notification for automatic rebalance
- **Partition Reassignment**:
  - 3-phase workflow: expand replicas → wait catchup → shrink
  - Throttling support to control data movement rate
  - Progress tracking with completion percentage
  - Safety: ISR quorum checks before moves
- **Admin API** (HTTP endpoints):
  - `POST /admin/topics/{name}/partitions` - Add partitions
  - `POST /admin/reassignment` - Start partition reassignment
  - `GET /admin/reassignment/{id}` - Get reassignment progress
  - `DELETE /admin/reassignment/{id}` - Cancel reassignment

- **Three batch triggers**: size (100), linger (5ms), bytes (64KB)
- **AckMode enum**: None/Leader/All (Leader/All same until M11)
- **HTTP REST API** with full CRUD for topics and publish/consume
- **Priority draining** in accumulator to prevent race conditions

### Milestone 3 - Consumer Groups & Offset Management ✅

### Milestone 4 - Reliability: ACKs, Visibility & DLQ ✅
- **Hybrid ACK model** - Per-message ACK combined with offset-based commits (best of SQS + Kafka)
- **Visibility timeout** - 30s default, configurable per-message, with heap-based tracking
- **Receipt handles** - Unique per-delivery (`topic:partition:offset:deliveryCount:nonce`)
- **Dead Letter Queue** - Per-topic DLQ with `.dlq` suffix, auto-creation, metadata preservation
- **Retry with exponential backoff** - Base 1s, multiplier 2x, max 60s
- **Max retries** - 3 attempts before DLQ routing
- **Extend visibility API** - For long-running processing tasks
- **ACK/NACK/Reject semantics**:
  - ACK: Success, message deleted, offset may advance
  - NACK: Transient failure, retry with backoff
  - Reject: Permanent failure, immediate DLQ

  - Level 0: 256 buckets × 10ms = 2.56 seconds
  - Level 1: 64 buckets × 2.56s = 2.73 minutes  
  - Level 2: 64 buckets × 2.73m = 2.91 hours
  - Level 3: 64 buckets × 2.91h = 7.76 days (max delay)
- **Delay Index** - Persistent storage for crash recovery
  - Binary format: 16-byte header + 32-byte entries
  - States: PENDING, DELIVERED, CANCELLED, EXPIRED
  - Per-topic index files in data/delay/{topic}/
- **Scheduler** - Coordinator connecting timer wheel, delay index, and broker
  - Schedule(topic, partition, offset, delay) - relative delay
  - ScheduleAt(topic, partition, offset, deliverAt) - absolute time
  - Cancel(topic, partition, offset) - cancel pending delivery
- **Broker Integration**:
  - `PublishWithDelay(topic, key, value, delay)` - relative delay
  - `PublishAt(topic, key, value, deliverAt)` - absolute timestamp
  - `CancelDelayed(topic, partition, offset)` - cancel pending
  - `GetDelayedMessages(topic, limit, skip)` - list pending

  - `internal/broker/timer_wheel_test.go` - Timer wheel tests
  - `internal/broker/delay_index_test.go` - Delay index tests
  - `internal/broker/scheduler_test.go` - Scheduler tests
- **Key Design Decisions**:
  - Messages written to log immediately (durability first)
  - Timer wheel tracks visibility, index tracks state
  - Zero/past delays fire immediately
  - Bucket position is authoritative (not DeliverAt time check)

### Milestone 6 - Priority Lanes ✅ ⭐
- **5 Priority Levels** - Critical(0), High(1), Normal(2), Low(3), Background(4)
  - Critical: Emergencies, circuit breakers (50% share)
  - High: Paid users, real-time updates (25% share)
  - Normal: Default traffic (15% share)
  - Low: Batch jobs, reports (7% share)
  - Background: Analytics, cleanup tasks (3% share)
- **32-byte Message Header** - Priority stored at position [24]

  - Configurable per scheduler
- **Per-Priority-Per-Partition Metrics (PPPP)**:
  - Ready count per priority
  - In-flight count per priority

- **HTTP API endpoints**:
  - `POST /topics/{name}/messages` - supports `priority` param
  - `GET /topics/{name}/messages` - includes priority in response
  - `GET /priority/stats` - per-priority-per-partition metrics
- **Files created/modified**:

  - DRR algorithm: O(1) dequeue, simple implementation
  - Priority persisted in message (survives restart)
  - Simplified versioning (V1 only during dev phase)
- **Bugs Fixed**:
  - uint8 underflow in loops (0 decrement → 255)
  - Segment reading always uses 32-byte header

### Milestone 7 - Message Tracing ✅ ⭐

### Milestone 9 - Transactional Publish ✅ ⭐
- **Idempotent Producers** - Exactly-once publish semantics
  - ProducerId (int64) + Epoch (int16) for identity
  - Per-partition sequence numbers for ordering
  - Sequence validation: rejects out-of-order, detects duplicates
  - Sliding deduplication window (default 5 sequences)

- **Transaction Coordinator** - Two-phase commit lifecycle
  - States: Empty → Ongoing → PrepareCommit/Abort → CompleteCommit/Abort
  - Transaction ID generation with timestamp + random hex

    - Per-partition map: `topic:partition → Set[offsets]`
    - `MarkAborted(offsets)` - Mark offsets from aborted transaction
    - `IsAborted(topic, partition, offset)` - O(1) lookup
    - Messages from aborted transactions never become visible
  - **Control Record Filtering** - Commit/abort markers invisible to consumers
    - `IsControlRecord()` method checks FlagControlRecord bit
    - Control records excluded from priority index
    - All 4 consume methods filter control records first
  - **Consume Filtering Pipeline** - Order matters for correctness:
    1. Filter control records (IsControlRecord)
    2. Filter delayed messages (deliverAt > now)
    3. Filter uncommitted transactions (UncommittedTracker.IsUncommitted)
    4. Filter aborted transactions (AbortedTracker.IsAborted)
  - **Transaction Completion Flow**:
    - Commit: `ClearTransaction()` removes from uncommitted → messages visible
    - Abort: `ClearTransaction()` returns offsets → `MarkTransactionAborted()` → messages permanently hidden
  - **Test Coverage**: 3 comprehensive tests
    - `TestBroker_UncommittedTransactionFiltering` - Uncommitted invisible, committed visible
    - `TestBroker_AbortedTransactionFiltering` - Aborted messages stay invisible forever
    - `TestBroker_MixedTransactionalAndNormalMessages` - Normal messages unaffected

  - `internal/storage/message.go` - Control record flags and payload
  - `internal/broker/broker.go` - TransactionCoordinator integration
  - `internal/api/server.go` - Transaction API endpoints (~600 lines)
- **Key Design Decisions**:
  - File-based transaction log (not internal topic like Kafka)
  - WAL + Snapshot pattern for efficient recovery
  - Epoch-based zombie fencing (not generation-based)
  - Heartbeat + timeout (same as consumer groups)
  - Flags byte for control records (not separate record type)
  - Per-partition sequence tracking (not per-topic)
  - Types match Kafka wire format (int64 PID, int16 epoch, int32 seq)

  - Dead timeout: 9s (3x interval) - marks node as dead
  - Background goroutine at heartbeat interval
  - `RecordHeartbeat(nodeID)` updates membership, recovers suspects
  - Status transitions: Unknown→Alive→Suspect→Dead
  - Integration with membership event system
- **Lease-Based Controller Election** - Single leader per cluster
  - `ControllerState` enum: Follower | Candidate | Leader
  - Epoch-based terms (monotonically increasing)

## Known Issues

### Visibility Tracking in Simple Consume (Deferred)

**Problem:** The simple consume endpoints (`GET /topics/{name}/partitions/{id}/messages/*`) don't track visibility timeout. They are read-only operations that simply fetch and filter messages from storage.

**Why This Matters:**
- Without visibility tracking, multiple consumers calling the simple consume API could get duplicate messages
- No receipt handles are generated (receipt handles are only for consumer groups)
- No ACK/NACK/Reject support (those operations require consumer group membership)

**Current Behavior:**
- Simple consume methods: Just read → filter → return (no state tracking)
- Consumer groups: Full lifecycle with ACK manager, visibility tracker, receipt handles

**Why Deferred:**
- Design decision: Keep simple consume truly simple for read-only use cases
- If you need reliability features (ACK, visibility, DLQ), use consumer groups
- Consumer groups already have full visibility tracking via ACK manager
- Simple consume is best suited for:
  - Debugging/inspection (manually looking at messages)
  - Replay/reprocessing (reading historical data)
  - Read-only analytics consumers
  - Testing and development

**When to Implement:**
- If users request visibility tracking for simple consume
- If we want to unify simple consume and consumer group consume patterns
- Consider: Would add complexity and state management to what's meant to be a simple API

**Related Code:**
- Consumer groups use: `internal/broker/ack_manager.go` + `visibility_tracker.go`
- Simple consume: `broker.Consume()`, `ConsumeByOffset()`, `ConsumeByPriority()`, `ConsumeByPriorityWFQ()`

## Lessons Learned

### Session 4 - Milestone 4
1. **Hybrid ACK model advantage** - Combining per-message ACK with offset commits gives both fine-grained control (retry single message) AND efficient progress tracking (offset-based recovery after crash).
2. **Min-heap for visibility tracking** - O(1) to check next expiring message, O(log n) for add/remove. Perfect fit for timeout-based tracking with potentially thousands of in-flight messages.
3. **Receipt handles encode location** - Including topic:partition:offset in receipt handle allows routing without database lookup. The nonce prevents replay attacks.
4. **DLQ auto-creation is essential** - Can't require users to pre-create DLQ topics. Auto-create with same partition count as original, with `.dlq` suffix for discoverability.
5. **Backpressure via MaxInFlightPerConsumer** - Without limits, a fast producer can exhaust memory. Default 1000 in-flight per consumer provides safe backpressure.

### Session 3 - Milestone 3
1. **Chi router URL params** - chi uses `chi.URLParam(r, "name")` to get URL params, not explicit arguments. Test code must call through `router.ServeHTTP()` not individual handlers.
2. **JSON partition keys as strings** - HTTP JSON APIs need partition IDs as strings (JSON keys), not ints. Convert with `strconv.Itoa()` for JSON serialization.
3. **Generation ID prevents zombies** - Stale consumers with old generation get rejected on heartbeat/commit. Critical for at-least-once guarantees.
4. **Stop-the-world rebalance tradeoff** - Simpler than incremental, but all consumers pause during rebalance. Good enough for v1; cooperative rebalancing in M12.

### Session 2 - Milestone 2
1. **Go's select is non-deterministic** - When multiple channels are ready, Go picks randomly. Fixed accumulator race condition by adding priority draining before flush/close.
2. **Pointer vs value semantics for channels** - `Send(record)` copies the struct, losing the `resultCh`. Fixed by creating `sendPtr(*ProducerRecord)` internal function.
3. **Test determinism with partitions** - Multi-partition defaults break tests that assume offset ordering. Solution: use single-partition configs in tests needing deterministic behavior.

# Storage engine settings
storage:

  # Bytes between index entries (smaller = more precise seeks, larger index)
  indexInterval: 4096  # 4KB
  
  # Sync writes to disk (safer but slower)
  syncOnWrite: false
  
  # Batch sync interval (if syncOnWrite is false)

# Cluster configuration
cluster:
  # etcd endpoints for coordination
  etcd:

  # Default replication factor for new topics
  replicationFactor: 2
  
  # Minimum replicas that must acknowledge write
  minInSyncReplicas: 1
  
  # How long to wait for replication before timeout
  replicationTimeout: "5s"

# Default topic settings (can be overridden per-topic)
defaults:
  topic:
    # Number of partitions for new topics
    partitions: 3
    
    # Retention settings
    retention:
      # Delete messages older than this (0 = infinite)
      hours: 168  # 7 days
      
      # Delete oldest messages when topic exceeds this size (-1 = unlimited)
      bytes: -1
    
    # Delivery settings
    delivery:
      # How long a message is invisible after fetch (for retry)
      visibilityTimeout: "30s"
      
      # Max delivery attempts before sending to DLQ
      maxRetries: 3

consumer:

  # Max time to wait for batch to fill
  lingerMs: 5
  
  # Acknowledgment mode: "none", "leader", "all"
